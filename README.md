This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in R related to data frame subsetting.  When attempting to select columns using a character vector that contains a column name that doesn't exist in the data frame, the standard `[` operator doesn't throw an informative error message. This can lead to unexpected behavior or silent failures.  The `bug.R` file shows the problematic code, and `bugSolution.R` offers solutions.
